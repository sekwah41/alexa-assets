# alexa-assets (Major WIP)

Currently mostly on npm to reserve the name and also show development progress

Simple assets for making rest responses to Alexa, the purpose of this project is to create objects and documentation to help with creating responses to make simple or complex skills easier.

Also for easier reading of the data sent by amazon due to markup though if you have taken a look at the json formatting it should be straight forward.

Uses language version ECMAScript 6 as that is what I am using generally for NodeJS atm.

I will not work on this right now but it is a project I will do. This is mostly here as a test npm repo to make sure its set up right

Possibly will make a constructor to help create SSML messages
