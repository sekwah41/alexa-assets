# alexa-assets (WIP)

Simple assets for making rest responses to Alexa, the purpose of this project is to create objects and documentation to help with creating responses to make simple or complex skills easier.

Uses language version ECMAScript 6 as that is what I am using generally for NodeJS atm.

I will not work on this right now but it is a project I will do. This is mostly here as a test npm repo to make sure its set up right
